    <h1>MUFFINNNNSSS!</h1>
    <p>Step 1
        Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Spray 12 muffin cups with cooking spray.
        
        Step 2
        Mix the flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt in a bowl.
        
        Step 3
        In another bowl, stir together the butter, egg, milk, zucchini, and garlic until well blended. Mix the flour mixture into the milk mixture, about 1/2 cup at a time, stirring between additions, until the flour mixture is incorporated. Fold in the Cheddar cheese, Parmesan cheese, and crumbled bacon, and pour the batter into the prepared muffin cups.
        
        Step 4
        Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center of a muffin comes out clean, 30 to 35 minutes. Allow muffins to cool slightly before removing from muffin cups; serve warm. Refrigerate leftovers.</p>
