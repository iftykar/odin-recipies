    <h1>Casserole</h1>
    <p>Step 1
        Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 2 quart casserole dish.
        
        Step 2
        Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil, add noodles, and cook until al dente; drain.
        
        Step 3
        In a large mixing bowl, combine noodles, tuna, celery, and green onion. Stir in sour cream, mustard, and mayonnaise. Season with salt and thyme. Spoon 1/2 of the noodle mixture into the prepared casserole dish. Arrange a layer of zucchini over the mixture. Top with the remaining noodles, followed by a layer of zucchini. Top the entire casserole with cheese.
        
        Step 4
        Bake in preheated oven for 30 minutes, or until hot and bubbly. Sprinkle the casserole with tomatoes before serving.</p>
